I am systems engineering student at the National university of Colombia. My interest are software architecture, cloud and project management. Moreover, I strongly agree with the fact that the life is for enjoy and for that reason I love to workout, hang out with friends, reading and being happy through a life balance. Over all, learning a lot of things each day. Finally, in this project I've worked on Color blindness and spatialÂ coherence.
