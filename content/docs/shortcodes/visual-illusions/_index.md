# Visual Illusions
Visual illusions are perceptual phenomena that occur when the brain interprets sensory information in a way that does not correspond to the physical reality of the stimulus. They are illusions that trick our brain into seeing something that is not actually there, or perceiving something in a way that is different from how it actually exists in the world.

Visual illusions can be caused by a variety of factors, including the properties of the visual system itself, as well as environmental and cognitive factors. There are many different types of visual illusions, including optical illusions, cognitive illusions, and physiological illusions.

Visual illusions can be used in a variety of fields, including art, design, and psychology, to explore the nature of perception and the workings of the human mind. They can also be a source of fascination and wonder, and have been studied by scientists, artists, and philosophers for centuries.
